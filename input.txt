If you are working with a deep learning project,
the greatest bottleneck could be the lack of computational resources (e.g a GPU).
But with Google Colaboratory (Google Colab or Colab in short),
now you have the freedom to use a GPU at your disposal.
Letâ€™s see how you can clone your GitHub repository into the Google Drive
and run your code on top of a GPU provided by Google Colab.
Here are some tips before you get in to Colab.
First, you have to get your scripts ready.
For scripting, you can use an IDE such as PyCharm,
Visual Code or Spyder.
When scripting,
it is a good practice to properly space the codes
and add comments whenever it is necessary.
